Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to my Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! 🚀
This project demonstrates a complete data warehousing and analytics solution — from ingesting raw data to delivering actionable insights. It is designed as a portfolio project to highlight my skills in SQL development, data engineering, ETL pipelines, and data analytics.

🏗️ Data Architecture

This project follows the Medallion Architecture with three layers: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.

Bronze Layer: Raw data ingested from ERP and CRM source systems (CSV files) into SQL Server.

Silver Layer: Data cleansing, transformation, and normalization to prepare for analytics.

Gold Layer: Business-ready data modeled in a Star Schema for reporting and dashboards.
